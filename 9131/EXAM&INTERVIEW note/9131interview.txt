Assignment 2 重要提示‼
1. 理解Array && ArrayList 不同 + 增删改查CRUD + 范围
Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class. ArrayList, it can only store objects

Methods of Creating Arrays
In Java, the following are two different ways to create an array. 

Simple fixed-sized arrays
Dynamically sized arrays
int arr[] = new int[10] 

Now let us dwell on the next concept of ArrayList that is as follows 
Syntax: Declaring an Arraylist
Arraylist<Type> al = new ArrayList<Type> ;

2. static field and method用法，为什么用
 To make a static field, you simply place the static keyword before the declaration of a class’s member variable, or field:

public class Human {
    public static int numHumans = 7;
    ...
}

 public static int getNumHumans(){
        return numHumans;
    }

3. for each loop /while /for loop，4种loop的写法，必要时候掌握迭代iterator的写法
// create an array
int[] numbers = {3, 9, 5, -5};

// for each loop 
for (int number: numbers) {
  System.out.println(number);
}
	
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

4. 理解file IO读取
Following constructor takes a file name as a string to create an input stream object to read the file −

InputStream f = new FileInputStream("C:/java/hello");

Following constructor takes a file object to create an input stream object to read the file. First we create a file object using File() method as follows −

File f = new File("C:/java/hello");
InputStream f = new FileInputStream(f);


Following constructor takes a file name as a string to create an input stream object to write the file −

OutputStream f = new FileOutputStream("C:/java/hello")
Following constructor takes a file object to create an output stream object to write the file. First, we create a file object using File() method as follows −

File f = new File("C:/java/hello");
OutputStream f = new FileOutputStream(f);

5. 理解try catch exception
try {
  //  Block of code to try
}
catch(Exception e) {
  //  Block of code to handle errors
}

The throw statement allows you to create a custom error.
if (age < 18) {
      throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.");
    }


6. logic explanation - class definition - method definition - line definition - expression definition (这行/段/方法/类是干什么用的，删了会引起什么后果)


7. comment 所有的class/method/loop必须有注释


8. code format 代码格式，换行，空格


9. class template， 每个class都要有default-cons/non-default cons/get/set/display 方法


10. test whale，仿照week7，要有Test Plan + actual test
